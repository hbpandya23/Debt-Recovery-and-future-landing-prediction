# Debt Recovery and future lending Prediction Model
> It a Big Data project where i have done Data Analysis and Python programming conclude it in timely manner.
I have done some research on internet that what finacial institutes are doing in debt recovery and lending loans. Credit score, annual income, due mortgages, loans and many other features.

##1.Got Data Set from Kaggle.
First thing i did was look for a dataset to use in my project that have similarities like above mentioned features in it. Dataset that consist of features i needed to successfully complete my Project.
i came accross so many similar dataset, but the one i chosen was uploaded in repository.

##2. Data Preprocessing.
Dataset i got was raw data. it needs to be processed before you do any training or modelling on to data and make predictions.
This data set was having so many dimensions that was useless in performing prediction. so i got rid of those features.
Data Preprocessiing is a challenge because it includes missing data, corrupt data, data normalization, wrong data types, feature recreation etc.

##3. Feature Engineering 
we need to some visulaization as well as python programming to verify the correlation between data. There are various libraries in python that we can use to determine correlation coefficient and determine relationship. 
Thsi is most effective to get best possible results from data.
Various visulization like heat map and pair plot are very effective in correlation establishments.

##4. Classification
After that you need to convert data into numeric form as classification algorithms mostly work with numeric data.
used python libraries to convert data to numeric.

##5.Modelling 
Used algorithms to make predictive models best suited for data and we can we can match accuracy and classification report of each algoritm and select best out of it.
